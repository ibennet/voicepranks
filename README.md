# voicepranks — Minion Voice Changer

Real-time "Minion voice" microphone filter for macOS and Windows, written in
pure Python (numpy + sounddevice, hand-rolled DSP — no scipy/librosa).

It captures your physical microphone, pitch-shifts it up (chipmunk-style,
formants move up too) with a presence-EQ boost that ramps in over ~1.2s, and
routes the result to a virtual audio device so apps like Discord, Zoom, or
OBS can pick it up as their microphone input.

## How it works

```
physical mic -> capture -> pitch shift up + presence EQ (ramped in) -> virtual output device
```

The virtual device is [VB-CABLE](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/) ("CABLE Input")
on Windows, or [BlackHole](https://existential.audio/blackhole/) on macOS.
Install one of those first, then point your voice/video app's microphone
input at it.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- `numpy`, `sounddevice` (see `requirements.txt`)
- A virtual audio cable driver (VB-CABLE on Windows, BlackHole on macOS)

## Install

```
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the GUI

```
python -m minion_voice
```

Toggle the effect on/off, pick your input device and the detected virtual
output device, and tune every DSP knob (pitch amount, EQ, Minionese
gibberish-mode params, WSOLA pitch-engine internals, I/O) from a scrollable
grid of sliders/checkboxes -- one control per entry in `params.PARAM_SPECS`,
so nothing is hidden behind a hardcoded module constant anymore. Hit
**Record** and the effect runs in real time while it captures the processed
output; **Play** replays that live take verbatim (no re-render). Tick **Live
monitor** to also hear it on your speakers while recording. **Re-render &
Play** is a secondary A/B flow: it re-runs the *dry* mic through a fresh
effect with whatever settings are currently dialed in.

The GUI also starts a small local HTTP control API by default (see below),
so the same params can be tuned live from the command line or a script
while the window is open. Set `MINION_NO_SERVER=1` to disable it.

## Live tuning over HTTP (control server)

Every param in the registry (`minion_voice/params.py`) is readable/writable
over a tiny stdlib-only JSON API, so you (or Claude, or a shell script) can
tweak the sound *while the engine is running*, without touching the UI.

Run it headless (no window, no display needed):

```
python -m minion_voice.server
```

This prints the base URL (default `http://127.0.0.1:8765`) and blocks. The
Tkinter app (`python -m minion_voice`) starts the same server in a
background thread automatically, so `curl` and the sliders drive one shared
engine and stay in sync -- an API-driven change shows up in the Tkinter
sliders on their next status poll, and vice versa.

Endpoints (JSON in/out unless noted):

| Method | Path | Body | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/state` | | `{specs, values, status}` -- full param schema, current values, engine status (incl. level meter) |
| POST | `/api/params` | `{"name": value, ...}` | Set one or many params by dotted name |
| POST | `/api/engine/start` | `{input_device?, output_device?}` | Start the audio streams |
| POST | `/api/engine/stop` | | Stop the audio streams |
| POST | `/api/engine/toggle` | | Start if needed, then flip the effect on/off |
| GET | `/api/devices` | | List input/output devices |
| POST | `/api/devices` | `{input_device?, output_device?}` | Switch devices (restarts streams if running) |
| POST | `/api/record/start` | | Start recording (captures the live processed output + the dry mic) |
| POST | `/api/record/stop` | | Stop recording |
| POST | `/api/render` | | Re-render the dry take with the *current* params (A/B flow) |
| POST | `/api/play` | `{"which": "live"\|"raw"\|"rendered"}` | Play a take (default `live`) through the output device |
| POST | `/api/save` | `{"path": ..., "which": "live"\|"raw"\|"rendered"}` | Save a take to a WAV file |
| GET | `/api/recording.wav?which=live\|raw\|rendered` | | Download a take as WAV bytes |
| GET | `/` | | Minimal read-only status/params page |

Example tuning loop:

```
curl -s localhost:8765/api/state | jq .values
curl -s -XPOST localhost:8765/api/params -d '{"minionese.semitones": 6.5}'
curl -s -XPOST localhost:8765/api/record/start
# ...speak...
curl -s -XPOST localhost:8765/api/record/stop
curl -s -XPOST localhost:8765/api/play          # plays the live processed take
```

## Record and playback

Recording captures two takes at once:

- **live** — the processed effect output, captured block-by-block exactly as
  it is produced in real time. `play()` replays this verbatim; nothing is
  re-rendered or re-applied, so it's a faithful "as it sounded live" capture.
  This is the default take for `play`/`save`/`recording.wav`.
- **raw** — the dry (pre-effect) mic signal, kept so the effect can be
  **re-rendered** onto the same take with different params (`/api/render` →
  the `rendered` take), an optional A/B tuning flow that doesn't disturb the
  live engine's own state.

`play()` plays a take (`live`, `raw`, or `rendered`) through the selected
output device; `save()`/`GET /api/recording.wav` write it out as a 16-bit PCM
WAV. Tick **Live monitor** (or `POST /api/params {"monitor": true}`) to also
hear the processed audio on your speakers while recording.

## Presets

Two built-in voice presets ship in `presets.py`:

- **minion** — connected, pitched-up, sing-song (no scramble).
- **animalese** — chopped/scrambled staccato blips.

Click the **Minion** / **Animalese** buttons in the GUI (or `POST
/api/presets/apply {"name": "minion"}`; list them with `GET /api/presets`) to
apply one instantly. Presets set the **voice character only** — they don't
touch your input/output devices, on/off state, or the live monitor. Edit
`PRESETS` in `presets.py` to change them or add your own.

## Audition the effect with no audio hardware

`selftest.py` reads/writes WAV files directly, so you can hear the effect
without any mic or virtual cable set up:

```
python -m minion_voice.selftest out.wav
python -m minion_voice.selftest in.wav out.wav --semitones 8 --eq-db 8
```

If no input WAV is given, a 2-second synthetic test tone (200 Hz with a
little vibrato) is generated and processed instead.

## Troubleshooting

**Blank / empty window on macOS.** Apple's *system* Python (`/usr/bin/python3`)
ships with Tk 8.5, which renders blank windows on modern macOS. Use a Python
built against a newer Tk:

```
brew install python-tk
python3 -m venv .venv          # uses Homebrew's python3 (Tk 8.6+/9.0)
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The app prints a warning at startup if it detects a broken Tk.

**BlackHole not detected right after installing it.** macOS only scans for
audio drivers when `coreaudiod` starts, so a fresh install may be invisible
until you restart the audio daemon (`sudo killall coreaudiod`) or reboot.

## Run the tests

```
pytest -q
```
