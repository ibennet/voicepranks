"""PyInstaller spec for VoicePranks.

One committed spec drives both macOS and Windows one-folder builds.
Build with:  pyinstaller voicepranks.spec --noconfirm

Notes:
- sounddevice wraps PortAudio; its native lib must be collected explicitly.
- tkinter / Tcl-Tk are pulled in by PyInstaller's standard hooks.
- macOS wraps the output in a .app BUNDLE and declares microphone usage so
  the OS actually grants mic access (without it the input stream is denied).
- Unsigned by design (casual distribution). Users click past the OS
  "unidentified developer" warning; see INSTALL.txt.

Only values that differ from PyInstaller's defaults are set below.
