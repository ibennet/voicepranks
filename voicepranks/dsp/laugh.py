"""Random procedural "goofy laugh" injector.

A *generator* stage (unlike the transform stages): it emits a short laugh and
randomly mixes it on top of the voice, ducking the voice a touch underneath it.
Used by the "goofy" preset to punctuate speech with an occasional laugh.

The laugh comes from a real audio clip when one is present at
`voicepranks/assets/goofy_laugh.wav` (loaded once via the stdlib `wave` module
-- no MP3/ffmpeg dependency; resampled to the engine rate if needed). If that
asset is absent, it falls back to a fully synthesized giggle so the feature
still works with no bundled audio.

The synthesized fallback models a real laugh rather than a pure tone: a
band-limited sawtooth *glottal source* (buzzy voiced excitation with a natural
harmonic rolloff), shaped by three *vocal formant* resonances (reusing
`PeakingEQ`) so it lands on a laugh vowel, with *breath noise* aspiration
puffing at each syllable onset and a short noisy "-ck" release at the end.
Pitch rises across the laugh (the "a-hyuck" lift) with a gentle warble.

Triggering is speech-gated (it only laughs while you're actually talking, so it
punctuates rather than fires into dead air) and rate-limited by a cooldown so
it never spams. Randomness comes from a seeded `np.random.default_rng` (same
convention as the other DSP stages) so tests are reproducible; `reset()`
restores the seed and clears any in-flight laugh.

`process()` returns the same number of samples it receives (it mixes onto the
incoming voice block), so it slots into the plain path like any other stage.
Intensity scales both how often it laughs and how loud, so at intensity 0 it is
silent -- the whole effect fades under the master intensity control.
