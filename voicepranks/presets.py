"""Built-in voice presets: named bundles of sound-character params.

A preset is a curated `{param_name: value}` dict drawn from
`params.PARAM_SPECS`. It intentionally covers only *sound-character* params
(the gibberish/shuffle knobs) and leaves out `io.*`, `enabled`, `monitor`,
and `intensity` -- so applying a preset changes the voice without disturbing
your devices, on/off state, live monitor, or your intensity setting.

`intensity` is deliberately excluded so it stays a live master control: it
scales the applied preset's character (wobble depth + scramble strength), and
applying a preset never resets it.

Applying is done by `VoiceEngine.apply_preset`, which just feeds each entry
through `set_param`. The two presets below were dialed in by ear during live
tuning; edit the values here (or add entries) to change/extend them.
