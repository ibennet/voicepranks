"""Bundled-asset resolution + packaging guards.

The stock laugh clips (and the webui page) are loaded from package data files.
A `__file__`-relative path works from source but breaks in a PyInstaller build
-- notably the macOS .app, which splits code and data -- so they must resolve
via `resource_path`. And every clip the picker offers must be listed in the
PyInstaller spec, or its button can't switch to it in a packaged build (the
exact bug where "scooby never plays" in a release while working from source).
